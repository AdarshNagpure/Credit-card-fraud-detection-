In the present era, hundreds of millions of transactions occur daily, with online scams and frauds becoming increasingly widespread. Recognizing fraudulent credit card transactions is crucial for credit card companies to enhance customer service and prevent unauthorized charges for unapproved purchases. The goal of this project is to develop a service using machine learning models to predict and identify fraudulent credit card transactions.

In this project we have build three models using logistic regression, Decision tree, ensemble model like Random forest, and Neural Networks. Then we see and compare their F1 score and accuracy and see the Confusion matrix of all the models.
